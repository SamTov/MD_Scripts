# MD_Scripts
Various scripts for molecular dynamics simulations.

When running MD simulations one often has to do several small tasks that get repetitive and can be trivially automated.
This repository will store some scripts that I write during my work that can perhaps be used by others easily. 

## Scripts
* box_calculator.py will return the side length of a cubic box of a given density of atoms that you gave input. It will
do the same for a spherical box

## Running the scripts
All the scripts are written in python and can be run with
```
python script.py
```
